# Shiletto Engine

The Shiletto-Engine is an engine designed to create casino games with.


## Reason

I have been working in the i-gaming industry for over 10 years now, and created
some engines for the companies I worked at. I have been looking for a project
that I can do in my freetime, but it also should benefit me in my work.

Thinking about what I should make, or create as a project.
I came up with the idea of creating an engine, that works the way I would like to be able 
to create games with.
